All notable changes to PerfSentinelHub are recorded here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Initial NativeAOT Hub release with durable SQLite findings, authenticated push ingestion, recovery polling, retention, and Helm deployment support.
- `first_seen` comes from the daemon envelope (`first_seen_ms`) instead of the Hub's poll clock, clamped to the observation time and to a Unix-ms sanity floor so neither a clock running ahead nor a seconds-unit bug can distort the irreversible MIN. `last_seen` deliberately stays the Hub's own observation clock, since retention, ordering and the freshness guard compare it and must read one monotonic clock. A finding's age now reflects when the daemon first detected it, not when the Hub first heard about it.
- A `backup` CLI command (`PerfSentinelHub backup <destination>`) snapshots the live database with SQLite `VACUUM INTO`, refuses to overwrite an existing destination, cleans up its partial file on failure, and rejects a wrong arity with a usage message instead of falling through to the server. Comes with a `make backup` wrapper and a documented backup and restore procedure. The database volume is the only non-reconstructible state the Hub holds.
